- stack handles code in a linear path

- javascript stack is only capable of doing one thing at a time

- browsers have web api that can allow for asynchronous code

- when a funciton is called that uses a webapi it sends the function to the web api
    - webapi processes data then moves it to the tasks
        - event loops moves tasks to the stack only when the stack is currently empty so that a string of code being executed does not get corrupted
