I believe your browser is caching your js
you could power refresh your browser, or clear browser cache?

chrome control+f5 or shift + f5
firefox it is control + shift + r







A more simple solution just type 

sudo fuser -k 8000/tcp 

This should kill all the processes associated with port 8000.
